# Income-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models


This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 using demographic and other related features. We used the Census Income Dataset from the UCI repository, which includes attributes such as age, education, occupation, and hours worked per week. The target variable is Income, a binary classification task, with the following two classes:

<= 50K: Individuals earning less than or equal to $50,000 per year. > 50K: Individuals earning more than $50,000 per year.

We applied three different machine learning models—Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM),and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—to develop the predictive models.
The performance of each model was evaluated to determine which approach provides the most accurate classification of income categories.
